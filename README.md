INFORMATION ABOUT THE APP: 


This is a workout organizing crud application based on the previous prototype presented.
(Not as polished as the prototype, but it gets the job done!)
Uses firebase for database storage, css for styling, and jquery to run the backend.


I would've used scss, but my computer is properly out of storage and scss functions failed to function and I needed to have a little bit of styling done.

CRUD FEATURES: 


==SIGN UP== 


Clicking the sign up button lets you create an account, currently rudimentary and only asks for username and password. Adds it to the database then updates the document with docref id for dynamic access to subcollections. 


==DAY WORKOUT==


Once you log in with your username, you will be greeted with a list of days and a welcome message. Clicking on a day will open "XXXXXXX Workouts" with the options to add, update, and delete. If there are no workouts already/this is your first time after signing up, you will want to click on add workout first.


==ADD WORKOUT==


Clicking add workout gives you a form. Simply fill the information out and click on the "Add New Workout" button. This will send you back to the page for the day you were on with the workout updated. Image URLs for images. (Create + Read)


==UPDATE WORKOUT==


Clicking the update workout button pulls a dropdown of each workout you have in the day, and then you can click on the workout you wish to update. This opens a form with the information you currently have. Change the information fields you wish to change and click on "Update Workout" to update the workout. (Update)


==DELETE WORKOUT==


Click on the "Remove Workout" button, which lists a dropdown with each workout you have. Click the workout you wish to delete and it will be deleted. (Delete)
